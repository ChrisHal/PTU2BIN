TODOs
2021-09-08 Improve handling of frame triggers. They seem to be inconsistent, either marking begin
or end of frame. - done (?)

2021-08-31 support for all(?) formats - partially done, T2 mode is missing
Note: Need to know how laser sync is recorded. Probably as channel events?

2021-08-26
checking if all data is present in file header - done

2019-09-11
Add support for counting of all channels. Idea: Zero or negative channel
number indicates that we want data from all channels. -done

2019-09-12
Suppress display of progress indicator ("spinner") in non-terminal /
non-interactive sessions (this makes it easier to capture the output
when run from a script, e.g. convertPTUs.py) - done

2019-09-18
Some more info in output would be nice:
1. time per pixel = pixel dwell time - done
2. date/time of recording (I hate date/time handling...) - done (testing needed?)
3. max. countrate per pixel (i.e. for the brightest pixel)
(can be calculated from from counts and number of frames and dwelltime?)

2019-09-24
Add export to Igor Pro binary wave file. Decide on file-extension of
outfilename parameter which format to use for export. - done
